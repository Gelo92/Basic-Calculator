# Basic-Calculator
Calculator that performs basic functions coded in c++

The goal of this project, as documented in this report, is to design an Object-Oriented C++ implementation of a standard or RPN pocket calculator. The user interface is expected to contain a keypad for input, and a screen for output. The calculator is implemented in visual studio IDE. An overview on the standard and RPN calculator operation is given together with the proposed high-level solution. Performance criteria and the testing techniques were discussed and the allocation of tasks for this project is provided as well as the project management.
